# Smartsteem.com Blacklist

Adding new accounts is possible by editing the `list.txt` via [PR](https://github.com/smartsteem/blacklist/pulls)

The following attributes are required.

- `account` => name of the account that should be added
- `reason` => one of the following: `spam`, `promoAbuse`, `illegal` 
- `validator` => unique identifier of the person who reported the account

More details should be added into the PR, as text.

Approval of PRs is not guaranteed, but it's much appreciated in the fight against abuse on Steem.
