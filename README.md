# Smartsteem.com Blacklist

Adding new accounts is possible by editing the `list.txt` via [PR](https://github.com/smartsteem/blacklist/pulls).

Take a look at the GIF below for an explanation.

![](https://github.com/smartsteem/blacklist/blob/master/how_to.gif)

The following attributes are required.

- `account` => name of the account that should be added
- `reason` => one of the following: `spam`, `promoAbuse`, `illegal`, `plagiarism ` (or others if they fit, but consistency is key!)
- `validator` => unique identifier of the person who reported the account

More details should be added into the PR, as text.

Submission of abusers is much appreciated, however, approval is not guaranteed.
